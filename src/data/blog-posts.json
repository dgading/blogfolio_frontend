    "content":  "<p>If you have visited my site in the past, you may have seen a flat HTML site with a little Angular or a Bolt CMS build and most recently a Drupal 8 site. The new version is a full Universal React build. I prototyped the site out in Ember and React and after hitting a few road blocks with Ember decided to continue on with the React build.<\/p><p>Trying to build a portfolio and blog with React will be a continuing adventure, trying to keep the site quick/responsive but also SEO friendly. Since React is geared toward that smooth and quick transition of pages, I’m not too worried about that. But the SEO will be fun to manage. As of this blog post, I am lacking in page specific meta descriptions and updating title tags in the HTML head element. <\/p><p>If you have taken the time to click around you may also notice the Projects section is a hot mess. I am waiting until I connect my Mongo DB and Express server to this site before I start adding to much to that section. It will house Projects I’m currently working on with any related blog posts to the project.<\/p><p>I hope you check back soon. I should have more posts in the next couple of weeks as I finish the last few items on my TODO list and move the repository from my Private list to Public. <\/p>"

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.<\/p><p>Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. With practice comes confidence. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Trees grow however makes them happy.<\/p><p>Brown is such a nice color. This is your world. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.<\/p><p>You're meant to have fun in life. Put it in, leave it alone. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?<\/p>"
